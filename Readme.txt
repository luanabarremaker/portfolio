Hello everyone!

I want to share a basic demonstration I created on GitHub to explore Git. As a first-semester student, learning about version control was crucial.

I utilized a template to showcase essential functionalities like git status, git add, git commit, git push, and git pull. These tools are fundamental for managing code and collaborating in a team.

Although I didn't develop the project from scratch, I learned a lot by exploring its functionalities.
